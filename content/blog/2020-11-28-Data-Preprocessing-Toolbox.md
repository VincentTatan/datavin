## Introduction
Data scientists spend most of their time preparing data.

According to CrowdFlower 2016 survey, data scientists are known for spending huge time on data preparation. 

Data preprocessing has become the necessary skill that every data scientist and engineer needs to have.

## Why do we need Data Preprocessing?
Data needs to be cleaned and chopped. 

You need to detect for outliers, replace missing values, transform normalized values, encode categorical values before deciding to deploy a machine learning solution. 

Every machine learning problem has different data assumptions (e.g: rule based/distance based), which requires different ingredient handling. Therefore, to produce high quality analysis, you need to master your data preprocessing.

## Modules Descriptions:
* Data Exploration with Pandas Profiling
* Binning
* Imputing new values
* Remove outliers
* Transform logs
* Categorical one hot encoding
* Scaling
