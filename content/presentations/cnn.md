## Introduction
Imagine Google Photos: for all of the pictures you have, how do you label those by objects. Do you want to tag them one by one? Is it possible to do a search on your latest Chicken Maryland snapshots? Enter CNN!

## Understanding image classification
Our brains are the master at determining objects quickly. When you enter a grocery store, you can separate bananas from other goods such as shoes. My 2 year old niece knew how to differentiate cats and dogs.
Yet to teach those classifications with computer is very hard.

## CNN
CNN is a type of neural network model which allows us to extract higher representations for the image content. 

Unlike the classical image recognition where you define the image features yourself, CNN takes the imageâ€™s raw pixel data, trains the model, then extracts the features automatically for better classification.

## CNN Method
* Convolution
* Activation Function
* Maxpooling (Aggregation)
* Fully Connected Layer
* Transfer Learning
