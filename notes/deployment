Use TinyLetter and Zapier
1. Set up TinyLetter account

TinyLetter is a personal newsletter service created by the same people who make MailChimp.
TinyLetter is for people who donâ€™t need all the business features that come along with MailChimp. Simplicity is at the heart of everything we do at TinyLetter.
TinyLetter is a completely free service.1
Unfortunately, the company plans to merge TinyLetter into their MailChimp offering.2 I still recommend it for the time being due to its sheer simplicity.
