Use TinyLetter and Zapier
1. Set up TinyLetter account
TinyLetter email address: beamer-8ef11a50e9b45db86bb064024b3885fa270cea07@tinyletter.com to send newsletter.

TinyLetter is a personal newsletter service created by the same people who make MailChimp.
TinyLetter is for people who donâ€™t need all the business features that come along with MailChimp. Simplicity is at the heart of everything we do at TinyLetter.
TinyLetter is a completely free service.1
Unfortunately, the company plans to merge TinyLetter into their MailChimp offering.2 I still recommend it for the time being due to its sheer simplicity.

1. Set up Zapier account

Zapier is a service that allows you to set up integrations (zaps) between web services, email, RSS, apps, devices, etc. You configure a trigger and allows the service to run
Zapier is not required. But this will automate the process better.

It will check your blog's RSS feeds every 5 minutes, automatically format, and send email to tinyletter.
